                    <p>I paint abstract, expressionistic work in loud colors.<br>
                        Not because I'm cheerful. Because subtlety can be dishonest.</p>

                    <p>I don't start with concepts, sketches, or a comforting plan. I start when something refuses to
                        stay quiet. The canvas is not a safe space—it's a negotiation that usually escalates. Control
                        exists, but only after things get messy.</p>

                    <p>Color is doing the heavy lifting. It carries tension, irritation, clarity, and the occasional
                        bad
                        mood. If a painting feels balanced, it's probably lying. I'm not interested in harmony; I'm
                        interested in pressure—what happens just before things look like they might fall apart.</p>

                    <p class="highlight-text">Music is always present. It is the music that inspires me. Always.</p>

                    <p>I paint in periods, not habits. Long silences followed by intense bursts. Inspiration is
                        unreliable, but when it shows up, it expects full attention and leaves a mess.</p>

                    <p>This isn't art designed to calm a room.<br>
                        It's art that occupies it.<br>
                        If it makes you slightly uncomfortable, that's not a side effect—it's quality control.</p>
